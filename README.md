# Manifestos

A Git repository containing UK party political manifestos in open data formats.

## About this fork

In March 2015 I started working on a project to automatically convert PDF
manifesto documents into more open data formats and to make them available for
reading, searching and linking-to in a single place, with particular focus on
the 2015 UK general election. I've got some of the way there with
[manifestos.org.uk](http://manifestos.org.uk), but the variety in source
documents has made fully-automated, single-step parsing and conversion
prohibitively difficult.

I recently heard about [Sym Roe's](https://twitter.com/symroe)
[DemocracyClub/manifestos](https://github.com/DemocracyClub/manifestos)
repository and decided that it offered a great solution: Use a Github repo as an
extra level of indirection.

While the original repo contained the source of a django web app with similar
functions to [manifestos.org.uk](http://manifestos.org.uk), this repo just
contains the open format versions of the manifesto documents. I think this
de-coupling is useful.
